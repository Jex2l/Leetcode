# ⚡ LeetCode Solutions in C++

Welcome to my LeetCode playground – a carefully crafted archive of algorithmic challenges, all solved in **C++**. This repository is more than just a collection of files; it’s a chronicle of my journey to master data structures, algorithms, and coding patterns that power real-world systems.

Whether it’s for interview prep, competitive programming, or sharpening core problem-solving skills, this repo is a go-to source for clean, efficient, and thoughtfully written solutions.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

- ✅ **Handwritten C++ solutions** across Easy, Medium, and Hard levels  
- 🔢 **Folder-by-problem** structure with kebab-case naming for clarity  
- 📄 Each folder contains:
  - A `.cpp` file with my solution  
  - A `README.md` summarizing runtime, memory usage, and quick notes  
- 🧠 Code that focuses on both **clarity** and **performance**

## 🚀 Why This Exists

I started this repo with three goals in mind:

- 🧠 **Build a rock-solid base** in data structures and algorithms  
- 🛠️ **Write clean, reusable C++ code** with a focus on time & space complexity  
- 💼 **Stay interview-ready** for top tech companies and system design roles  

Over time, it’s evolved into a personal toolkit that I reference, revisit, and refine.

## 📈 Roadmap

- ☑ Solve 300+ problems with full coverage across core categories  
- 🔁 Refactor older solutions with better patterns and STL usage  
- ✍️ Add solution explanations and complexity breakdowns  
- 📊 Integrate markdown indexing or tags for faster topic search
